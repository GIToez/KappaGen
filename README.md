# KappaGen 2

KappaGen is the premier plugin that allows twitch.tv streamers to show the emotes from chat on their stream!

**How does it work?**

Go to https://cbenni.com/kappagen/ and set your settings and enter your channel name.
It then gives you a URL to use in a CLR browser on your stream (or whatever equivalent you are using)

Make sure to put the CLR Browser on top of the game.

**Features**
tl;dr: Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cVMAwWLMN0) by twitch.tv/onslaught!

* Customize it with ratelimits, sizes, emote choices
* Supports BTTV and FFZ, and of course, all twitch emotes
* Emotesplosions when someone follows and/or subscribes
* No login required! Just add it the way it is.
* Allow your mods to change settings via chat commands (note that the commands do not show a response in chat) - the commands are listed on the settings page
* Different animations for emotes:
 - zoom: the animation you know so far
 - bubble: similar to the periscope hearts
 - blur: blurring the emote in and out of view
 - bounce: solitaire-style bouncing emotes
* Cloud sync - your settings are automatically synced between the settings page and OBS
* Connect your GameWisp account to KappaGen on the settings page to get subscriber-only mode and emotesplosions for your gamewisp subs
* You can now set KappaGen to exclusively use emotes from your channel - works for twitch subscriber, BTTV and FFZ emotes.
* Open source! ( https://github.com/CBenni/KappaGen )
* Of course it is, and will always be free. Donations are obviously appreciated, but in no way demanded <3

**Why should I use it?**

If you like twitch emotes (and your chat does, too) then its simply a fun thing that allows chat to directly interact with the stream. I have gotten VERY positive feedback from many people ;)

**Future development**

I am currently happy with the software as such, but I will be adding things as they get requested!
I would be happy for any feedback, since only with feedback can I improve the app :)
